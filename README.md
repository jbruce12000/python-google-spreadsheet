Google Spreadsheets API
========================
A simple Python wrapper for the Google Spreadsheeta API.
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yoavaviram/python-google-spreadsheet.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yoavaviram/python-google-spreadsheet)



Features
--------

* An object oriented interface for Worksheets
* Supports List Feed view of spreadsheet rows, represented as dictionaries
* Compatible with Google App Engine


Requirements
--------------
Before you get started, make sure you have:

* Installed [Gdata](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/) (pip install gdata)
* setup oauth2 for your app https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library
  * pick a web app
  * set the redirect uri to http://localhost:8080/
  * grab the client_id and client_secret
* put the client_id and client_secret in a local json formatted file named ./client_secrets.json like this...

    {
    "web": {
        "client_id": "XXXXXXXXX",
        "client_secret": "XXXXXXXX",
        "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost"],
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"
        }
    }

* the spec is here... https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_client_secrets if you care
* the first time you run this, it will open a browser and have you verify it is ok for this app to access your google account.  after that, it'll be cached in a local file named ./creds.dat.

Usage
-----

List Spreadsheets and Worksheets:

     >>> from google_spreadsheet.api import SpreadsheetAPI
     >>> api = SpreadsheetAPI()
     >>> spreadsheets = api.list_spreadsheets()
     >>> spreadsheets
     [('MyFirstSpreadsheet', 'tkZQWzwHEjKTWFFCAgw'), ('MySecondSpreadsheet', 't5I-ZPGdXjTrjMefHcg'), 
     ('MyThirdSpreadsheet', 't0heCWhzCmm9Y-GTTM_Q')]
     >>> worksheets = api.list_worksheets(spreadsheets[0][1])
     >>> worksheets
     [('MyFirstWorksheet', 'od7'), ('MySecondWorksheet', 'od6'), ('MyThirdWorksheet', 'od4')]

Please note that in order to work with a Google Spreadsheet it must be accessible
to the user who's login credentials are provided. The `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_SOURCE`
argument is used by Google to identify your application and track API calls.

Working with a Worksheet:

    >>> sheet = spreadsheet.get_worksheet('tkZQWzwHEjKTWFFCAgw', 'od7')
    >>> rows = sheet.get_rows()
    >>> len(rows)
    18
    >>> row_to_update = rows[0]
    >>> row_to_update['name'] = 'New Name'
    >>> sheet.update_row(row_to_update)
    {'name': 'New Name'...}
    >>> row_to_insert = rows[0]
    >>> row_to_insert['name'] = 'Another Name'
    >>> row = sheet.insert_row(row_to_insert)
    {'name': 'Another Name'...}
    >>> sheet.delete_row(row)
    >>> sheet.delete_all_rows()

Advanced Queries:

    >>> sheet = spreadsheet.get_worksheet('tkZQWzwHEjKTWFFCAgw', 'od7')
    >>> rows = sheet.get_rows(query='name = "Joe" and height < 175')

Or filter in memory:

    >>> sheet = spreadsheet.get_worksheet('tkZQWzwHEjKTWFFCAgw', 'od7')
    >>> filtered_rows = sheet.get_rows(
            filter_func=lambda row: row['status'] == "READY")

Sort:

    >>> sheet = spreadsheet.get_worksheet('tkZQWzwHEjKTWFFCAgw', 'od7')
    >>> rows = sheet.get_rows(order_by='column:age', reverse='true')

That's it.

For more information about these calls, please consult the [Google Spreadsheets
API Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/).

Tests
------
To run the test suite please follow these steps:

* Make sure [Nose](http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/) is installed: (`pip install nose`)
* Create a local file named: `test_settings.py` with the following variables set to the relevant values: `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_USER`, `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_PASSWORD`, `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_SOURCE`, `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_KEY`, `GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_KEY`, `COLUMN_NAME`, `COLUMN_UNIQUE_VALUE`
* Run `nosetests`
